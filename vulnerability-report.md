##Revieiwing Joey's Learning Journal

##Exposure

I attempted to destroy Joey's database with SQL injection but it did not seem to work as I was able to continually use his application to create new entires.  I enteres the following text into the 'title' text box:

```
' or '1'='1'-- drop table entries;

```

This SQL injection attempts to end the previous statement and begin a new one with 'drop table'.  In this test attack, the attacker would have somehow already known the name of the table that holds journal entires.

##Repair

My attempt to destroy Joey's database failed because he properly uses SQLAlchemy ORM instead of plain SQL queries.  The ORM handles protection against SQL injection attacks.
